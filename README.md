## Overview

Laracommece API is designed to provide a robust and scalable solution for e-commerce applications. The API is built using Laravel and follows best practices for code organization and maintainability.

## Features

- **N-Layer Architecture**: Separation of concerns using Controllers, Services, Repositories, Models, Form Requests, and API Resources.
- **Repository Design Pattern**: Abstract data access logic for better maintainability and testability.
- **API Serialization**: Consistent and structured API responses.
- **Clean and Minimal Code**: Focus on readability and simplicity.
- **Comprehensive Doc Block Comments**: Well-documented code for better understanding and collaboration.

## N-Layer Architecture

The N-Layer architecture in Laracommece API consists of the following layers:

1. **Models**: Represent the data structure and relationships.
2. **Repositories**: Abstract the data access layer, interacting with the database.
3. **Form Requests**: Handle validation and authorization of incoming requests.
4. **Controllers**: Handle HTTP requests and responses.
5. **Services**: Contain business logic and interact with repositories.
6. **API Resources**: Transform models into JSON responses.

This separation of concerns ensures a modular and maintainable codebase.
